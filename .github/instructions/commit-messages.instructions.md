# Commit Messages Instructions

Keep the commit message short and concise, possibly just one sentence.  
Use imperative mood and avoid unnecessary details. If applicable, reference related issues or pull requests.  
Don't write verbose or overly detailed descriptions; focus on clarity and conciseness.
